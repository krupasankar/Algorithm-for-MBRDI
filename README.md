# Algorithm-for-MBRDI
The major task the young engineers is to make a vehicle smarter and to achieve this we need the smartest technique.  One such sensor which is can be used for detecting path and obstacles is the LIDAR which can be used instead of normal camera. The steps for achieving this are as follows: The LIDAR will be mounted either over the bonnet or the roof of the vehicle.  Lidar takes numerous point from the path it travels and we have to preprocess the data which we obtain from the LIDAR sensor. All the data that the LIDAR senses is send to the micro-processor  raspberri pi and is then coupled to a ML model to eliminate the unwanted data. Using various ML (machine learning) approaches such as Faster RNN , Mask RNN and SSD, we will be able sort out the required data with high accuracy.  Finally this data is send to a cloud which can further be obtained from the LIDAR 360 software.  Using this software we will be able  to simulate the specified model types to control all traffic system , lane path identification and smart vehicle system. and thus a magnificent solution can be developed.
